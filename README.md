# qsoftware-code

Code used in the paper [Overview and Comparison of Gate Level Quantum Software Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02500), also featured on [Quantum Computing Report](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/). 

Note that this code is included here for full data transparency in the paper, but it is not guaranteed to work with the current versions of QISKit, pyQuil, or ProjectQ. I will do my best to keep these examples up to date as these software packages evolve. Current versions of most of these examples can be found on the respective platforms:

* [Forest](https://github.com/rigetticomputing)
* [QISKit](https://github.com/QISKit)
* [ProjectQ](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ)
* [QDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum)

Note that example code from the QDK is not included in this repository because it was taken (nearly) verbatim from the QDK tutorials.
